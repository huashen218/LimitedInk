This project is about investigating <em>if the shortest rationales are best understandable for humans</em>. This repository includes the codes of:

- <strong>LimitedInk</strong>: A self-explaining model that can control rationale length.
- <strong>User Interface</strong>: the user interface and codes to implement MTurk experiments.


The work is to support the paper 
["Are Shortest Rationales the Best Explanations For Human Understanding?"](https://hua-shen.org/assets/files/ACL2022_LimitedInk.pdf)
, which is accepted by the [ACL 2022 main conference](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/).
